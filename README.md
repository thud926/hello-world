# hello-world
test repo for first signup

first time using github, learning web development; so much to absorb, so few hours in a day! Re-learning HTML/CSS/JS, progressing to jQuery & Bootstrap.  Future goals: PHP, SQL, Python, Ruby (hopefully I'll be on my way to getting PAID to do this stuff by the time I grok those) bash programming, maybe eventually C++ and C.  Anything I can learn to get into coding for a living.  Not getting any younger! :)
